    <h3 class="tittle"> <em> Description </em></h3>

    <p class="text">
        Lacquered with <em> <strong class="a"> barbecue sauce,</em> </strong> this juicy chicken swaps constant 
        flipping on the <em> <strong class="a"> grill </strong> </em> for a mostly hands-off process using the oven 
        and one smart trick: The dry-rubbed chicken roasts most of the way 
        on top of barbecue sauce. The resulting sauce becomes thickened and 
        glossy from the chicken's rendered fat. It's then spooned onto the 
        chicken and roasted until sticky, caramelized and rich with flavor. 
        Serve the extra sauce with dinner, for dipping chicken, or spooning 
        directly into your mouth. (For boneless barbecue chicken, try this 
        stovetop method.)
    </p>

    <ul class="ul">
        <li> 1(18-ounce) jar barbecue sauce, or 2 cups homemade barbecue sauce</li>
        <li> About 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken leg quarters or thighs, patted dry</li>
        <li> 1tablespoon neutral oil (such as grapeseed)</li>
        <li> 2teaspoons store-bought or homemade chili powder </li>
        <li> 1teaspoon smoked paprika </li>
        <li> Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)</li>
        <li> 1teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> <em> Steps for preparation </em></h3>

    <ol>
        <li> Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Pour the barbecue sauce 
            into a 9-by-13-inch baking pan or dish, or a large skillet, 
            or another ovenproof vessel that fits the chicken snugly, then 
            shake so the sauce disperses into an even layer.</li>
        <li> In a large bowl, toss the chicken with the oil, chili powder, 
            paprika and 1 teaspoon salt until coated. Arrange the chicken, 
            skin side up, on top of the barbecue sauce. Roast until the chicken 
            skin is crisp, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li> Scrape the sides of the pan and stir the barbecue sauce to incorporate 
            the caramelized bits into the sauce. Turn the chicken to coat in the 
            sauce, arrange skin-side-up, then spoon sauce on top of the chicken. 
            Roast until the chicken is sticky and charred in spots, 10 to 15 minutes 
            more.</li>
        <li> ransfer chicken to plates. Stir the apple cider vinegar into the sauce 
            remaining in the pan. Serve the chicken with the extra sauce.</li>
    </ol>
