    <h3 class="tittle"> <em> Description </em></h3>

    <p class="text">
        Here is a recipe for an oven-roasted version of the classic street-side 
        flavor bomb usually cooked on a rotisserie. It is perfect for an evening 
        with family and friends. Serve with pita and tahini, chopped cucumbers 
        and tomatoes, some olives, chopped parsley, some feta, fried eggplant, 
        hummus swirled with harissa, rice or rice pilaf. You can make the 
        white sauce that traditionally accompanies it by cutting plain yogurt 
        with mayonnaise and lemon juice, and flecking it with garlic. 
        For a red to offset it, simmer ketchup with red pepper flakes and a 
        hit of red-wine vinegar until it goes syrupy and thick, or just use your 
        favorite hot sauce instead.

            <li> 2 Pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs </li>
            <li> 1 Large red onion, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li> 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 > <em class="a"> Steps for preparation </em></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare a marinade for the chicken. Combine the lemon juice, 
                ½ cup olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, turmeric, 
                cinnamon and red pepper flakes in a large bowl, then whisk to combine. 
                Add the chicken and toss well to coat. Cover and store in refrigerator 
                for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>
                When ready to cook, heat oven to 425 degrees. 
                Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a 
                rimmed sheet pan. Add the quartered onion to the chicken and 
                marinade, and toss once to combine. Remove the chicken and onion 
                from the marinade, and place on the pan, spreading everything 
                evenly across it. </li>
            <li>
                Put the chicken in the oven and roast until it is browned, 
                crisp at the edges and cooked through, about 30 to 40 minutes. 
                Remove from the oven, allow to rest 2 minutes, then slice into 
                bits. (To make the chicken even more crisp, set a large pan over 
                high heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, then the 
                sliced chicken, and sauté until everything curls tight in the heat.) 
                Scatter the parsley over the top and serve with tomatoes, cucumbers, 
                pita, white sauce, hot sauce, olives, fried eggplant, feta, 
                rice — really anything you desire.</li>
